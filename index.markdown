# Education

I am currently studying for an [M2 Mathematics (Optimisation)](https://www.master-in-optimization.fr/) master degree at École Polytechnique (France) as part of their [PhD track programme](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/phd-program); supported by a [Sophie Germain Scholarship](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/our-programs/transversal-programs/graduate-program/apply-for-a-sophie-germain-scholarship/) from the Fondation Mathématique Jacques Hadamard.

Before this I completed a 3 year [BSc Mathematics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/mathematics-g100/) followed by a 1 year [MSc Mathematics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/mathematical-sciences-g1k509/) at Durham University (England, UK). In both degrees I attained first class marks in every module taken, and I recieved the Norton Prize for outstanding performance in 2021. I completed my master's thesis on regularity of optimal transport maps, under the supervision of Dr Alpár Mészáros.

My CV (October 2024) is available [here](assets/Ford-CV-20th-Oct-2024.pdf).

# Research Interests

In my current M2 programe I am specialising in theoretical aspects of optimisation and their connection with PDEs and game theory. Specifically, I am interested in pursuing research in fields related to optimal transport, mean field games, optimal control and the calculus of variations.
