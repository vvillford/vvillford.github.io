# Education

I am currently studying for an M2 Mathematics (Optimisation) master degree at École Polytechnique (France) as part of their PhD track programme; supported by a [Sophie Germain Scholarship](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/our-programs/transversal-programs/graduate-program/apply-for-a-sophie-germain-scholarship/) from the Fondation Mathématique Jacques Hadamard. You can find details of the course [here](https://www.master-in-optimization.fr/).

Before this I completed a 3 year [BSc Mathematics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/mathematics-g100/) and 1 year [MSc Mathematics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/mathematical-sciences-g1k509/) at Durham University (England, UK) where I completed my master's thesis on optimal transport under the supervision of Dr Alpár Mészáros.

My full CV (September 2024) is available here.

# Research Interests

I am specialising at the interface of Optimisation and PDEs, particularly with regard to optimal transport, optimal control and mean field games.
