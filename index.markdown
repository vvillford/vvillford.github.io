# Education

I am currently studying for an [M2 Mathematics (Optimisation)](https://www.master-in-optimization.fr/) master degree at École Polytechnique (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) as part of their [PhD track programme](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/phd-program); supported by a [Sophie Germain Scholarship](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/our-programs/transversal-programs/graduate-program/apply-for-a-sophie-germain-scholarship/) from the Fondation Mathématique Jacques Hadamard.

Before this I completed a 3 year [BSc Mathematics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/mathematics-g100/) followed by a 1 year [MSc Mathematics](https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/mathematical-sciences-g1k509/) at Durham University (England, UK). In both degrees I attained first class marks (très bien) in every module taken, and I recently recieved the Winton MSc Memorial Prize for the highest average marks on the MSc programme. I also recieved the Norton Prize for outstanding performance in the first year of my BSc in 2021. I completed my master's thesis on regularity of optimal transport maps, under the supervision of Dr Alpár Mészáros.

My CV (December 2024) is available [here](assets/Ford-CV.pdf).

# Research Interests

In my current M2 programe I am specialising in theoretical aspects of optimisation and their connection with PDEs and game theory. I am interested in pursuing a PhD in fields connected to optimal transport and its (many) applications, with a specific view towards those in Machine Learning.
